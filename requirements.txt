Hardware

A 64-bit computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux. Higher RAM/VRAM improves training speed. Minimum recommended: 8 GB RAM, 4-core CPU. GPU (NVIDIA CUDA) optional but beneficial for faster training.

Development Environment

Visual Studio Code used as the primary code editor. Miniconda/Anaconda used for environment and package management. Google Colab used for accelerated model training and experimentation.

Libraries & Packages	

1. TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning framework for the CNN model.
2. Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing.
3. NumPy – Numerical operations.
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization.
5. OpenCV / Pillow – Image loading and preprocessing.
6. scikit-learn – Train–test split, preprocessing, evaluation metrics.
7. Streamlit – Web-based UI for model deployment.
8. tf-keras-vis / Grad-CAM utilities – Generating Grad-CAM heatmaps.
9. ReportLab / PyPDF2 – Generating structured PDF analysis reports.

Dataset:

MRI dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes brain MRI images categorized into Alzheimer’s stages: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Demented.

Notebook & Environment:	
Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook used for model development, experimentation, visualizations, and training workflow.
